## TODO
- particles: things falling (magic, leafs)
- audio:
  - steps sound should use something different than a stepper, regular timed is fine(ish) but they should start as soon(ish) i start moving
  - breath at stop, leafs happening every so often
- control: mouse controls missing
- textured flashlight
- ~fog: particles, posteffect~
- ~assimp: load multiple files (not clear cache on each load)...use classes/macro?~
- text: inner thoughts/quote
- different endings/events/cutscenes monsters with small animations talking on text with growl for sfx
- bloom
- wind for grass trees
