### About

CEPL based template that I use to make things. Started on [shiny](https://github.com/azimut/shiny/tree/a787e66ba097c84e940c88579672cd15a7a48bb0/examples) but grew too "big" and I am trying to control it more...it might never happened.

Mostly a copy of [play-with-verts](https://github.com/cbaggers/play-with-verts) for now.
